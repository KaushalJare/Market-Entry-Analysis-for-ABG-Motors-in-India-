# Market-Entry-Analysis-for-ABG-Motors-in-India-

Understanding the Problem Statement
ABG Motors, a Japanese car manufacturer, is considering entering the Indian market. To assess the profitability of this expansion, the company wants to ensure that it can sell at least 12,000 cars in the Indian market within a year.
Task: Analyze sample data from two major cities (one in India and one in Japan) to understand sales patterns and build a classification model that predicts whether an individual is likely to buy a new car.

Data Preparation and Exploration
Data Acquisition: Obtain the "Indian Dataset" and "Japanese Dataset" from ABG Motors.

Data Cleaning: 
Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
Correct inconsistencies or errors in data.
Normalize numerical features to a common scale (e.g., min-max scaling or standardization).

Feature Engineering:
Create new features that might be relevant (e.g., age group, income bracket, car type preference).
Consider feature selection techniques (e.g., correlation analysis, feature importance) to identify the most informative features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize distributions of variables (histograms, box plots).
Examine correlations between features (correlation matrix).
Identify potential outliers or anomalies.
Model Building and Evaluation
Split Data: Divide the Japanese dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

Model Selection: Choose a suitable classification algorithm based on the nature of the data and problem. Consider options like:
Logistic Regression: A simple and interpretable model.
Decision Trees: Can handle non-linear relationships and provide insights into decision-making.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for better performance.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective for complex classification problems.
Neural Networks: Powerful models for handling large datasets and complex patterns.
Model Training: Train the selected model on the training set using appropriate hyperparameters.

Model Evaluation:
Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess model performance on the testing set.
Consider cross-validation to evaluate model generalization.
Model Tuning: If necessary, fine-tune hyperparameters to improve performance.
Making Predictions and Analysis
Predict on Indian Data: Apply the trained model to the Indian dataset to predict the likelihood of car purchases.
Estimate Sales: Based on the predictions and the population of the Indian city, estimate the potential number of car sales.
Compare with Target: Evaluate whether the estimated sales meet the target of 12,000 cars.
